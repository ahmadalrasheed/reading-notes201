***Traditionally, the term 'form' has referred to a printed document that contains spaces for you to fill in information. `HTML` borrows the concept of a form to refer to different elements that allow you to collect information from visitors to your site.***

**The best known form on the web is probably the search box that sits right in the middle of Google's homepage**

### Why Forms?

* to enabling users to search, forms also allow users to perform other functions online.


* You will see forms when registering as a member of a website.


* You will see forms when shopping online, and when signing up for newsletters or mailing lists.




### How Forms Work?

* > A user fills in a form and then presses a button to submit the information to the server.


* > The name of each form control is sent to the server along with the value the user enters or selects.


* > The server processes the information using a programming language such as PHP, C#, VB.net, or Java. It may also store the information in a database


* > The server creates a new page to send back to the browser based on the information received.



### Form Structure

* `<form>` : Form controls live inside a <form> element. This element should always carry the action attribute and will usually have a method and id attribute too.

* `action` : Every <form> element requires an action attribute. Its value is the URL for the page on the server that will receive the information in the form when it is submitted.


* `method`:  Forms can be sent using one of two methods: get or post.
