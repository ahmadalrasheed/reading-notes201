***JavaScript can be hard to learn and everyone makes mistakes when writing it. This chapter will help you learn how to find the errors in your code. It will also teach you how to write scripts that deal with potential errors gracefully.***

### Order of execution

***To find the source of an error, it helps to know how scripts are processed. The order in which statements are executed can be complex; some tasks cannot complete until another statement or function has been run***

**The following is an example of Error In Javascript**

#### From where to see Error

You can access your Errors and see what is wrong with your javascript code if you follow the steps below:


* > open inspect Element in your website page that you are working in

* > open console button 

* > after that you will see what is the error and in which line

### How to Deal With Errors

***Now that you know what an error is and how the browser treats them, there are two things you can do with the errors.***

* > DEBUG THE SCRIPT TO FIX ERRORS : If you come across an error while writing a script (or when someone reports a bug), you will need to debug the code, track down the source of the error, and fix it. You will find that the developer tools available in every major modern browser will help you with this task. In this chapter, you will learn about the developer tools in Chrome and Firefox. (The tools in Chrome are identical to those in Opera.) IE and Safari also have their own tools (but there is not space to cover them all).
