## Images

***Controlling the size and alignment of your images using CSS keeps rules that affect the presentation of your page in the CSS and out of the HTML markup.***

### controlling sizes of images in CSS

***You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box.***


***Specifying image sizes helps pages to load more smoothly because the HTML and CSS code will often load before the images, and telling the browser how much space to leave for an image allows it to render the rest of the page without waiting for the image to download.***


***You might think that your site is likely to have images of all different sizes, but a lot of sites use the same sized image across many of their pages.***



**Down below is an example of how You can control the sizes of images using CSS**

* HTML: 


> `<img src="images/magnolia-large.jpg"`
 `class="large" alt="Magnolia" />`
> `<img src="images/magnolia-medium.jpg"`
 `class="medium" alt="Magnolia" />`
> `<img src="images/magnolia-small.jpg"`
 `class="small" alt="Magnolia" />`


* CSS:

> `img.large {`
`width: 500px;`
`height: 500px;}`
`img.medium {`
`width: 250px;`
`height: 250px;}`
`img.small {`
`width: 100px;`
`height: 100px;}`


### Background Images

***The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box.***

***The path to the image follows the letters url, and it is put inside parentheses and quotes.***

***SEO is a huge topic and several books have been written on the subject. The following pages will help you understand the key concepts so you canimprove your website's visibility on search engines.its a big topic to discuss but we will talk about it breifly***


* **The Basics:** 



>***Search engine optimization (or SEO) is the practice of trying to help your site appear nearer the top of search engine results when people look for the topics that your website covers.***

>***At the heart of SEO is the idea of working out which terms people are likely to enter into a search engine to find your site and then using these terms in the right places on your site to increase the chances that search engines will show a link to your site in their results.***


* **On-Page Techniques:** 



>***On-page techniques are the methods you can use on your web pages to improve their rating in search engines.***

>***The main component of this is looking at keywords that people are likely to enter into a search engine if they wanted to find your site, and then including these in the text and HTML code for your site in order to help the search engines know that your site covers these topics.***



* **Off-Page Techniques:** 


>***Getting other sites to link to you is just as important as on-page techniques. Search engines help determine how to rank your site by looking at the number of other sites that link to yours.***

>***They are particularly interested in sites whose content is related to yours. For example, if you were running a website that sold fish bait, then a link from a hairdresser is not likely to be considered as relevant as one from an angling community,and this is the third technique***
